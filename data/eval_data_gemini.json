I remember an incident where a friend of mine and another student were playing in the halls, like all kids do, and accidentally bumped into a black kid. I was there, and he did not do it on purpose. He tried to apologize to the black, but by that time a group of other black students were approaching. All the blacks ganged up around my friend, so I stood in his defense. Then out of nowhere one of the black kids spit on me! Of course I then retaliated with a blow to the guy's face, then they all jumped in on me and I was out numbered 6 to 1! The teachers broke up the fight. We were all taken to the office. I tried to explain what had happened to the principal, but he would not listen to my account and sentenced me and the 6 black kids to detention. I thought it to be unfair and a weak stand on his part! And my friend was too scared of them to stand up for me because they had threatened him. That is just one of many instances that I recall. Such a shame the school never made a stand against this and many other occasions like this.]\n\nPlease respond with a summary indicating whether any extremist language is present and categorize it in only one of the provided categories accordingly.\nPlease give your response as valid JSON in the following format: {\"Label\": <INSERT YOUR CATEGORIZATION HERE (\"Propaganda\" or \"Radicalization\" or \"Recruitment\" or \"None\")>, \"Reason\": <INSERT YOUR REASON HERE>}."
