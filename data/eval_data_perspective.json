Negro culture inferiority is the consequence of the physical inadequacy of the Negro brain in dealing with abstract concepts. On the other hand, the Negro shows an ability approaching that of the White at mental tasks requiring only memory. That is why the Negro can be trained relatively easily to adapt to many aspects of White culture ... . It has been well known since the large-scale intelligence testing of U.S. Army recruits in World War I that the average Negro IQ is approximately 15 per cent below that of the average White. Apologists for the Blacks have tried to explain away the earlier test scores as being due to the effects of segregated schools and Black poverty; i.e. they claimed the tests were \"culturally\" biased"

Anne Frank perished - like millions of others, both Jewish and non-Jewish, in Europe during that terrible time - an indirect victim of history's most devastating war ... . Few people realize that Anne, along with father and sister, and thousands of other Jews, \"survived\" Auschwitz-Birkenau. Her father, Otto Frank, came down with typhus and was transferred to the camp infirmary there to recover. He was one of thousands of sick and feeble Jews who were left behind when the Germans abandoned the camp in January 1945, shortly before it was overrun by the Soviets. He died in Switzerland inAugust 1980 ... . If the German policy had been to kill Anne Frank and her father, they would not have survived Auschwitz-Birkenau.

This movement is usually called \"revisionism,\" because of the belief of its adherents that the history of wars is usually written by the victors, and the victors often have a lot of reasons for lying: covering up their own atrocities, and justifying extreme actions taken against those they wish to paint as \"evil.\" But what these Jewish spokesmen haven't told you is that it isn't only Revisionists who have questioned the six million figure.

I remember an incident where a friend of mine and another student were playing in the halls, like all kids do, and accidentally bumped into a black kid. I was there, and he did not do it on purpose. He tried to apologize to the black, but by that time a group of other black students were approaching. All the blacks ganged up around my friend, so I stood in his defense. Then out of nowhere one of the black kids spit on me! Of course I then retaliated with a blow to the guy's face, then they all jumped in on me and I was out numbered 6 to 1! The teachers broke up the fight. We were all taken to the office. I tried to explain what had happened to the principal, but he would not listen to my account and sentenced me and the 6 black kids to detention. I thought it to be unfair and a weak stand on his part! And my friend was too scared of them to stand up for me because they had threatened him. That is just one of many instances that I recall. Such a shame the school never made a stand against this and many other occasions like this."

This is a compact disc packed full of pro-white music, with different music tastes for everyone. The discs are mass-produced for distribution at schools, although you could distribute them elsewhere. This project was VERY successful and garnered TONS of support, as well as a lot of coverage from the media. I for one, would like to see this take off again...hell, I would LOVE to see us be even more successful this time around. It is up to YOUto make this happen. The price per CD is only 0.30 cents so I don't want to hear anyone complaining about how they cant afford it!!! HOWEVER...I would like you to continue reading before youparticipate in this project."
